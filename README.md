# Password Generator
## 
For this assignment, Module 3 challenge, I created a password generator that presents a series of prompts for the password criteria. The prompts will ask you for the length of a password, between 8 - 128 characters, and if you want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. After each prompt is answered, the generator will create a password based on the selected criteria.
